\title{Create a Consolidated Data Frame from Multiple Raw Count Files}
\usage{
create_df(raw_counts, files)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_counts}{A data frame containing an initial set of raw counts. This can be an empty data frame
or one that is pre-populated with some counts. It serves as the base to which new count data will be appended.}

\item{files}{A character vector of file paths to the raw count files. Each file is expected to be in a format
where it has no header and contains two columns.}
}
\value{
A data frame that consolidates the count columns from all the provided files, with non-count columns and
extra rows (such as "no_feature" or "ambiguous") removed.
}
\description{
This function reads and merges raw count data from several separate files into one data frame.
It processes each file by reading the data, assigning descriptive column names based on the file name,
and appending the count columns to the existing data. After processing, only columns with count values
are retained, and rows with labels such as "no_feature" or "ambiguous" (if present) are removed.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Loops over each file in \code{files} and reads the data using \code{\link[utils]{read.delim}} with \code{header = FALSE}.
\item Assigns column names to the data based on the file's base name, creating names like \code{genes_<filename>} and
\code{counts_<filename>}.
\item Sets the row names of the data frame using the first column, so that the count data can be merged by matching gene names.
\item Appends the new data to \code{raw_counts} using \code{\link[dplyr]{bind_cols}}.
\item Retains only those columns whose names start with "counts", effectively discarding the gene identifier columns.
\item Removes any rows where the row name matches \code{"no_feature"} or \code{"ambiguous"}, if present.
}
}
\note{
Before running this function, ensure you have defined the paths to your raw count files and that each file adheres
to the expected format (i.e., two columns with no header). Adjust the filtering of extra rows as necessary based
on your data.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create an initial raw counts data frame (this can be empty or contain initial data)
raw_counts <- data.frame(row.names = c("Gene1", "Gene2", "Gene3"))

# Define a list of file paths to the raw count files (modify the path and pattern as needed)
files <- list.files(path = "path/to/counts", pattern = "*.txt", full.names = TRUE)

# Consolidate the raw counts from all files into one data frame
consolidated_counts <- create_df(raw_counts, files)
}
