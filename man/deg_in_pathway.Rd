\title{Filter TPM Data by Pathway and Differential Expression}
\usage{
deg_in_pathway(tpm, deg, pathway)
}
\arguments{
\item{tpm}{A matrix or data frame containing TPM (Transcripts Per Million)
values, where row names correspond to gene names.}

\item{deg}{A data frame containing differential expression results. The row
names of this data frame should correspond to the genes identified as
differentially expressed.}

\item{pathway}{A vector of gene names representing the pathway of interest.}
}
\value{
A subset of the TPM data containing only the rows (genes) that are
present in both the provided \code{pathway} vector and in the row names of
\code{deg}.
}
\description{
This function filters a TPM data matrix to include only the genes that belong
to a specified pathway and are also identified as differentially expressed.
This is particularly useful for conducting pathway-specific analyses.
}
\details{
This function is designed for pathway-specific analyses. It intersects the set
of genes from the specified pathway with those identified as differentially
expressed (from \code{deg}). Ensure that the \code{deg} data frame is formatted
correctly with gene names as row names.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create an example TPM matrix with gene names as row names
tpm <- matrix(runif(100), nrow = 10,
              dimnames = list(paste0("Gene", 1:10), paste0("Sample", 1:10)))

# Create an example differential expression results data frame
deg <- data.frame(logFC = rnorm(10), p.value = runif(10))
rownames(deg) <- paste0("Gene", sample(1:10))

# Define a pathway of interest (vector of gene names)
pathway_genes <- c("Gene1", "Gene3", "Gene5")

# Filter the TPM matrix for genes in the pathway that are also differentially expressed
filtered_tpm <- deg_in_pathway(tpm, deg, pathway_genes)
}
