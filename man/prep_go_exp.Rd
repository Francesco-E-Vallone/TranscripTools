\title{Combine and Prepare GO Analysis Results for Export}
\usage{
prep_go_exp(go_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{go_list}{A named list of GO analysis results. Each element of \code{go_list} should itself be a named list
of data frames (or tibbles). Names should indicate database and direction (e.g. \code{"Reactome_Pathways_2024_Down"}).}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames. Each data frame contains an additional column \code{Database} indicating
the source of each row (taken from the nested list names).
}
\description{
This function takes a nested list of GO analysis results and, for each comparison/category,
combines the contained data frames into a single data frame by row-binding them.
A new column \code{Database} is added (from the names of the nested list elements) to indicate
the source database and direction (e.g. \code{"GO_Biological_Process_2025_UP"}).
}
\details{
Unlike earlier versions, this function does \strong{not} overwrite names with a fixed template.
This makes it robust to missing databases (very common in GO analyses) and prevents silent mislabeling.

combined_go_list <- prep_go_exp(go_list)
writexl::write_xlsx(combined_go_list, "GO_Analysis_Results.xlsx")
