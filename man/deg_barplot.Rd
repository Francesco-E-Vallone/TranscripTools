\usage{
deg_barplot(
  deg,
  tmm,
  title,
  pval_col = "adj.P.Val",
  logFC_col = "logFC",
  top_n = 30,
  direction = "UP"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{deg}{A data frame containing differential expression results, including at least a log fold-change column
and an adjusted p-value column. Row names should correspond to gene symbols.}

\item{tmm}{A normalized count matrix (e.g., TMM or TPM) with genes as rows and samples as columns.}

\item{title}{A character string specifying the title for the bar plot.}

\item{pval_col}{A character string specifying the column name in \code{deg} that contains adjusted p-values.
Default is \code{"adj.P.Val"}.}

\item{logFC_col}{A character string specifying the column name in \code{deg} that contains log fold-changes.
Default is \code{"logFC"}.}

\item{top_n}{An integer specifying the number of top DEGs to include in the plot. Default is \code{30}.}

\item{direction}{A character string indicating whether to visualize up-regulated genes ("UP") or down-regulated genes ("DOWN").
Default is \code{"UP"}. For up-regulated genes, only genes with \code{logFC > 1} are selected; for down-regulated genes,
only genes with \code{logFC < -1} are selected.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object representing a bar plot of the selected genes with their expression levels.
}
\description{
This function creates a bar plot of expression levels for the top differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
from a normalized count matrix (e.g., TMM or TPM). The function filters the DEG data frame based on a specified
adjusted p-value threshold and log fold-change, then selects and plots the top \code{top_n} genes. Gene names are italicized.
}
\details{
The function first filters the \code{deg} data frame to retain statistically significant genes (adjusted p-value below 0.05).
It then sorts the genes by log fold-change based on the specified \code{direction} ("UP" for up-regulated or "DOWN" for down-regulated)
and selects the top \code{top_n} genes. Next, the corresponding rows are extracted from the count matrix (\code{tmm}),
and the data is reshaped into a long format for plotting with ggplot2. Finally, a horizontal bar plot is created with gene names
displayed in italics.

\dontrun{
# Example usage with TMM-normalized data:
# Assume deg_df is a DEG results data frame and tmm_avg is a TMM-normalized count matrix.
plot_up <- deg_barplot(deg_df, tmm_avg, "Top 30 UP Genes", direction = "UP")

# For TPM-normalized data, the same function can be used:
plot_down <- deg_barplot(deg_df, tpm_avg, "Top 30 DOWN Genes", direction = "DOWN")
}
