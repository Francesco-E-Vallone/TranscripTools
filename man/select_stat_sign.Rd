\title{Select Statistically Significant Differentially Expressed Genes}
\usage{
select_stat_sign(dge_list, stat_sign, logFC_threshold = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{dge_list}{A named list of data frames, each containing DGE results. Each data frame should have a numeric column
for significance (e.g., p-value or adjusted p-value) and a \code{logFC} column indicating the log fold-change.}

\item{stat_sign}{A character string specifying the name of the significance column (e.g., \code{"p.value"} or \code{"adj.P.Val"})
used to determine statistical significance.}

\item{logFC_threshold}{A numeric value specifying the threshold for the absolute log fold-change.
Only genes with \code{logFC} greater than or equal to this threshold (or less than or equal to the negative
of this threshold) will be retained. Default is \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames, where each data frame contains only the statistically significant genes from
the corresponding element in \code{dge_list}. Any element of \code{dge_list} that is empty or lacks the specified
columns is skipped.
}
\description{
This function processes a named list of differential gene expression (DGE) data frames and filters each
data frame to retain only those genes that are statistically significant based on a specified significance
column and a log fold-change threshold. This is useful for selecting the most differentially expressed genes
across multiple analyses.
}
\details{
The function loops over each element in \code{dge_list} and for each one:
\itemize{
\item Checks if the data frame is empty; if so, it moves on to the next element.
\item Verifies that both the significance column (given by \code{stat_sign}) and the \code{logFC} column are present.
\item Filters the data frame to retain only those genes for which the significance value is less than 0.05 and
the absolute value of \code{logFC} is greater than or equal to \code{logFC_threshold}.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example: Suppose you have a list of DGE results:
dge_list <- list(
  condition1 = data.frame(p.value = runif(100), logFC = rnorm(100)),
  condition2 = data.frame(p.value = runif(100), logFC = rnorm(100))
)

# Filter the list using "p.value" as the significance column and a logFC threshold of 1
filtered_list <- select_stat_sign(dge_list, stat_sign = "p.value", logFC_threshold = 1)
}
