\title{Select Statistically Significant Differentially Expressed Genes}
\usage{
select_stat_sign(dge_list, stat_sign, logFC_threshold = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{dge_list}{A named list of data frames, each containing DGE results. Each data frame is expected
to have a numeric column for significance (e.g., p-value) and a \code{logFC} column indicating the log fold-change.}

\item{stat_sign}{A character string specifying the name of the significance column (e.g., "p.value" or "adj.P.Val")
used to determine statistical significance.}

\item{logFC_threshold}{A numeric value specifying the threshold for absolute log fold-change.
Only genes with \code{logFC} greater than or equal to this threshold (or less than or equal to the negative
of this threshold) will be retained. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames, where each data frame contains only the statistically significant genes,
skipping any empty element
}
\description{
This function processes a list of differential gene expression (DGE) results and filters each
data frame to retain only the genes that are statistically significant based on a specified
significance column and log fold-change (logFC) threshold. This is useful for selecting differentially
expressed genes from multiple analyses.
}
\details{
The function loops over each element in \code{dge_list} (skipping empty elements) and filters
the data frame based on the following criteria:
\itemize{
\item The value in the column specified by \code{stat_sign} is less than 0.05.
\item The absolute value of \code{logFC} is greater than or equal to \code{logFC_threshold}.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example: Suppose you have a list of DGE results
dge_list <- list(
  condition1 = data.frame(p.value = runif(100), logFC = rnorm(100)),
  condition2 = data.frame(p.value = runif(100), logFC = rnorm(100)),
)

# Filter the list using "p.value" as the significance column and a logFC threshold of 1
filtered_list <- select_stat_sign(dge_list, stat_sign = "p.value", logFC_threshold = 1)
}
