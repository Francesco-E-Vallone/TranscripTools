    "GO_Cellular_Component_2023", "Reactome_Pathways_2024")

}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame of DE results with rownames = symbols and a \code{logFC} column.}

\item{samples}{Character used in plot titles.}

}
\value{
Named list of ggplot objects (one per database).
}
\description{
This function performs Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on down-regulated genes from a differential
expression data frame. It works similarly to \code{up_go()} but filters for genes with \code{logFC} <= -1.
By default, a preset list of databases is used, but you can supply your own via the \code{databases} parameter.
Bar plots are generated for the top 20 GO terms.
