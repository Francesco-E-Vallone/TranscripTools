\title{Draw a Volcano Plot for Differential Expression Results}
\usage{
volplot(
  res,
  fdr_threshold = 0.05,
  fc_threshold = 1,
  colors = c(Up = "#FF8F8F", Down = "#30B3A9", `Not Significant` = "grey"),
  top_n = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A data frame of differential expression results that includes columns for log fold change (\code{logFC}),
p-values (\code{PValue}), and significance category (\code{sign}). It is recommended to run \code{add_significance()} first.}

\item{fdr_threshold}{Numeric, the FDR threshold used for drawing the horizontal reference line. Default is \code{0.05}.}

\item{fc_threshold}{Numeric, the log2 fold change threshold used for drawing vertical reference lines. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{colors}{A named vector of colors for the significance categories. Default is \code{c("Up" = "#FF8F8F", "Down" = "#30B3A9", "Not Significant" = "grey")}.}

\item{top_n}{An integer specifying the number of top up‑regulated and top down‑regulated genes to label on the plot. Default is \code{10}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the volcano plot.
}
\description{
This function creates a volcano plot from a differential expression results data frame.
It uses \code{ggplot2} and \code{ggrepel} to plot log2 fold changes versus -log10(p-value),
coloring points by their significance category. It also labels the top \code{top_n} up‑ and down‑regulated genes.
}
\details{
The function identifies the top \code{top_n} up‑regulated genes (highest \code{logFC}) and the top \code{top_n} down‑regulated genes
(lowest \code{logFC}) from those with p-values less than the threshold. These genes are then labeled on the plot using \code{geom_text_repel}.
The x-axis displays log2 fold change and the y-axis shows -log10(p-value). Dashed lines indicate the significance thresholds.
Important: run the add_significance() function prior to this one, as it is essential to have the labels of logFC direction ("Up", "Down", "Not Significant")

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assume deg_df is your differential expression results data frame and has been processed with add_significance()
volcano_plot <- volplot(deg_df, fdr_threshold = 0.05, fc_threshold = 1, top_n = 10)
}
