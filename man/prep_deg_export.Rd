\title{Prepare Differential Expression Results for Export}
\usage{
prep_deg_export(res_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{res_list}{A named list of data frames containing DEG results. Each data frame should have row names that represent gene identifiers.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames, where each data frame includes a new column \code{Genes} containing the original row names.
}
\description{
This function takes a list of DEG result data frames and adds the row names as a new column named \code{Genes}.
This is useful for exporting DEG results to file formats (such as XLSX, CSV, or TXT) where preserving gene identifiers
is necessary. When used with functions like \code{writexl::write_xlsx}, each element of the list can be saved as a separate
sheet in an Excel workbook.
}
\details{
The function iterates over each element in \code{res_list}, converts the row names into a new column named \code{Genes},
and returns the updated list. This transformation is helpful when exporting results, ensuring that gene identifiers
are not lost.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assume res_list is a list of DEG data frames obtained from an analysis:
res_list <- list(
  condition1 = data.frame(logFC = rnorm(50), p.value = runif(50), row.names = paste0("Gene", 1:50)),
  condition2 = data.frame(logFC = rnorm(50), p.value = runif(50), row.names = paste0("Gene", 51:100))
)

# Prepare the results for export by adding the gene identifiers as a column
res_deg <- prep_deg_exp(res_list)

# You can now export res_deg using writexl::write_xlsx(res_deg, "DEG_results.xlsx")
}

}
