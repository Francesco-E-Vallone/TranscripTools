\title{Average Specified Column Groups in a Count Matrix}
\usage{
average_cols(tmm, pairs)
}
\arguments{
\item{tmm}{A numeric matrix or data frame with row names representing genes and columns representing samples.}

\item{pairs}{A list where each element is a character vector of column names in \code{tmm} that should be averaged together.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same row names as \code{tmm} and one column per element in \code{pairs}. Each column contains
the average of the corresponding columns from \code{tmm}.
}
\description{
This function computes the row-wise average of specified groups of columns from a count matrix.
It returns a new data frame with averaged values and retains the original row names (typically gene names).
}
\details{
The function loops over each group specified in \code{pairs}, computes the row-wise mean (ignoring \code{NA} values),
and assigns a new column name by concatenating the first two elements of the pair using the format \code{"col1_n_col2"}.
This is useful when you want to simplify and summarize data from replicated samples prior to visualization, such as in a heatmap.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assume tmm is your count matrix and you have defined column groups to average:
pairs <- list(c("counts_RS1050_1_KIDNEY", "counts_RS1316_3_SPLEEN"),
              c("counts_RS1050_1_PB", "counts_RS1316_2_PB"),
              c("counts_RS1316_1_BM", "counts_RS9737_2_BM"))
averaged_tmm <- average_cols(tmm, pairs)
}
