\title{Average Columns by Group (e.g., Replicates or Conditions)}
\usage{
average_cols(tmm, meta)
}
\arguments{
\item{tmm}{Numeric matrix or data frame of expression values
(rows = genes, columns = samples).}

\item{meta}{Data frame with sample metadata.
Must contain a column named \code{group} and row names matching the
column names of \code{tmm}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same row names as \code{tmm} and one column
per group, containing the average expression values for that group.
}
\description{
Computes the mean expression for each gene across replicates that belong
to the same group, as defined in a metadata data frame.
}
\details{
This function is useful when visualizing summarized or “cumulated”
profiles, such as average expression per condition for heatmaps or PCA.
Missing values are ignored (\code{na.rm = TRUE}).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Average normalized counts by condition
tmm_avg <- average_cols(tmm, meta)

# Use averaged matrix for a heatmap
hmap(tmm_avg, title = "Group-Averaged Expression")
}

}
